/// each other's temp file. `fsync` runs before the rename so a power loss
/// in the window between `rename` landing and the temp file's data blocks
/// reaching disk can't leave a 0-byte target after reboot (the standard
/// ext4 `data=ordered` + delayed-allocation hazard).

/// After the rename we also fsync the *parent directory* — without that, the
/// directory entry pointing at the new inode is only in the page cache;
/// a power loss between rename and dir-fsync can leave the file referenced
/// by the old (deleted) inode after recovery. POSIX requires fsync of the
/// directory to make a rename durable.
///
/// If `path` already exists, the new file inherits its mode bits. Without
/// this, `File::create` writes 0644 and a previously-chmodded 0600 workbook
/// silently becomes world-readable after a save.
